## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am BjÃ¶rn, a PhD candidate in computer science at ETH Zurich, specializing in camera-based and wearable physiological sensing for health applications and intelligent computer agents. My primary research goal is to advance current health systems and intelligent computer agents by leveraging a person's remotely estimated physiological state, derived solely from video data. Using a person's physiological state, I aim to enhance understanding of their behavior, intent, and health to, for example, improve the quality of personalized assistance.

- ðŸ”­ **Dataset recordings**: During the initial phase of my PhD, I focused on recording multimodal datasets comprising synchronized video recordings and physiological signals, such as photoplethysmography (PPG) signals and electrodermal activity (EDA).
- ðŸ¤” **Machine learning:** Currently, I am developing novel signal processing and deep learning techniques to estimate these physiological signals from facial videos, for example, using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG).
- âš¡ **Future applications:** Ultimately, I aim to improve health solutions and intelligent computer agents using these signals.
