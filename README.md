## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am BjÃ¶rn, a PhD candidate at ETH Zurich, specializing in **egocentric and camera-based physiological sensing for intelligent computer agents and health applications**. My research focuses on advancing these systems by leveraging remotely estimated physiological and affective states derived solely from video data. By analyzing a personâ€™s physiological state, I aim to enhance the understanding of their emotions, intent, and health, ultimately improving the quality of personalized assistance.

- ðŸ”­ **Dataset recordings**: During the initial phase of my PhD, I focused on recording multimodal datasets comprising synchronized video recordings and physiological signals, such as photoplethysmography (PPG) signals and electrodermal activity (EDA).
- ðŸ¤” **Machine learning:** Currently, I am developing novel signal processing and deep learning techniques to estimate these physiological signals from facial videos, for example, using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG).
- âš¡ **Future applications:** Ultimately, I aim to improve health solutions and intelligent computer agents using these signals.
